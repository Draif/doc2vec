# doc2vec
My own implementation of Doc2Vec.
Don't judge hard, this code was written in 3 days with a lot of coffe and little sleep. ;)

## How to use it
Just compile it with [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software))(Makefile is near the rest of source code).
When you compile the code and get the binary, there is a help command(--help).

Also you can examine run.sh file. This is a simple example of using doc2vec on some dataset.
